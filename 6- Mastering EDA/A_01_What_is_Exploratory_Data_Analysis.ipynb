    "The data exploration is very important part of  data analysis .We always need to investigate quality of our data .EDA is the first step of the data analysis process. It enables to summarize data's main characteristics .So we can detect outliers, missing values in the data set or visualize each feature's mean,median,mode values to understand better data .We can also understand if there is a relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. Thanks to feature engineering ,we can create a new features or transforming some features.As a result ,we use more useful features.\n"
